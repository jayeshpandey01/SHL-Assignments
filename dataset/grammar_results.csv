audio_529.wav," My favorite place to visit is my local cinema. It is close to my house, so I don't take any vehicle there. I work there. I order a popcorn or whatever drink I need. Then I sit and watch the movie playing in the cinema. The reason I love this place is because I get to be among the first set of people to watch a movie and not come to an online platform like Twitter or Reddit and see information about the movie when I have one.",3.633851,"My favorite place to visit is my local cinema.

audio_762.wav," Oh, I would have to say my favorite hobby is Dungeons & Dragons. It's very nice to play with other people. Though any limitations are really your imagination. In a kitchen table, maybe some snacks. Four or five friends together, place some adventures, some dyes. It's a very imaginative, thought-attent, extensive game. Which is great. And it's fun for all ages. It does get a bad rap because they liked it with Satanism. I think Satan has anything in it. It was a D6 or a D12 or a D20. It's just, you know, Christians get, they just leave everything evil. So it makes them more exclusive to their cool, like D&D is just a five-board game they can play. And that's the last game.",3.3681786,"I would have to say my favorite hobby is Dungeons & Dragons. It's very nice to play with other people. Though any limitations are really your imagination.
